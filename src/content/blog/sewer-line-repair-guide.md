# Understanding Sewer Line Repair: Trenchless vs Traditional Methods

Sewer line issues can be a homeowner's nightmare, but modern technology has made repairs less invasive and more efficient. At Probst Excavating, we specialize in trenchless sewer line repair serving Aurora, Lawrenceburg, and the Tri-State area.

## Common Signs You Need Sewer Line Repair

Watch for these warning signs:

- Foul odors around your property
- Wet spots in your yard from seepage
- Slow drains throughout your home
- Gurgling sounds from toilets or drains
- Sewage backing up into your home

## What Causes Sewer Line Damage?

Several factors can damage your sewer lines:

1. **Tree Root Invasion** - Roots seeking moisture can infiltrate and crack pipes
2. **Age & Corrosion** - Older pipes deteriorate over time
3. **Ground Shifting** - Soil movement can misalign or crack pipes
4. **Clogs & Blockages** - Built-up debris can cause pressure and damage

## The Trenchless Advantage

Our trenchless approach offers significant benefits:

### Minimal Lawn Damage
Unlike traditional methods that require digging large trenches across your property, trenchless repair uses small access points.

### Faster Completion
Most trenchless repairs can be completed in a day or two, compared to a week or more for traditional methods.

### Cost-Effective
Save money on landscaping restoration and reduce labor costs.

### Long-Lasting Results
Modern materials used in trenchless repair can last 50+ years.
