# Site Preparation and Grading Services in Aurora, Indiana

Proper site preparation and grading are the foundation of any successful construction project. At Probst Excavating, we've been preparing sites throughout Aurora, Lawrenceburg, and the Tri-State area for over 20 years.

## Why Site Preparation Matters

Before any construction begins, your property needs to be properly prepared. This critical step ensures:

- **Stable Foundation** - Proper soil compaction prevents settling
- **Water Drainage** - Correct grading directs water away from structures
- **Code Compliance** - Meets local building requirements
- **Cost Savings** - Prevents expensive issues down the road

## Our Site Preparation Process

### 1. Site Survey and Planning
We assess your property's unique characteristics, including soil type, existing drainage, and local regulations specific to Dearborn County.

### 2. Land Clearing
Remove trees, stumps, vegetation, and debris to create a clean working area.

### 3. Excavation and Grading
- Excavate to required depths for foundations
- Grade the site to ensure proper drainage
- Create access roads and work areas
- Prepare utility trenches

### 4. Soil Compaction
Properly compact soil to prevent future settling and ensure structural stability.

### 5. Final Grading
Fine-tune the contours to direct water flow and prepare for construction or landscaping.
